# Project Plan 

1. Collect data by scraping and use of APIs 
1. Parse and load scraped data to database 
1. Model topics and label data appropriately (USDA food items) 
1. Devise generative methods for "healthy shifts" in food choice.  
1. Create schedule of weekly recipes that meet nutritional requirements 

## 


1. Start with previous knowledge / simple models 
1. Build and improve with iterations 

--- 
* Generate user questionnaire 
* Deploy Web App
--- 

## Brainstorm  
* The best way to obtain reliable user information is user history.  What has the user eaten in the past?  Solicit meal history of the past week.  
* For a given food item, what is the best way to generate a list of healthy alternatives?
